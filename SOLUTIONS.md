# 🔐 SOLUTIONS.md — Gated Reference Solutions

> **Read this only after you've attempted the matching exercise in `EXERCISES.md` and explicitly asked to see the solution.**
> Reading ahead defeats the point — the exercise is where the actual learning happens, not the solution.
>
> The AI will not open or paste from this file until both gate conditions in `.agents/workflow/next.md` STEP 3.5-C are met:
> 1. You've pasted/described a real attempt (even a broken or partial one).
> 2. You've explicitly asked to see the solution.

**Entry numbering matches `EXERCISES.md` exactly** — Exercise 1.1-1 → Solution 1.1-1, etc.

## Entry Format

```
### Solution <module#>.<n> — <short title>

**Reference implementation:**
​```rust
fn example() -> Result<(), TradingError> {
    if quantity == 0 {
        return Err(TradingError::InvalidQuantity);
    }
    // ...
    Ok(())
}
​```

**Line-by-line:**
- `if quantity == 0 { ... }` — why this check, why here, what it prevents.
- `return Err(TradingError::InvalidQuantity)` — why this error variant, how `?` would propagate it upstream.
- ...

**Compared to your attempt:**
- What matched.
- What differed, and why the reference approach was chosen (performance, idiom, correctness).
- Any misconception the diff reveals, so it doesn't repeat next exercise.
```
